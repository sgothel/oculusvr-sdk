        // 1. It undoes the distortion that happens at the edges of the lens.
        // 2. It maps the undistorted field into "retina" space.
        // So the input is a pixel coordinate - the physical pixel on the display itself.

        //      that the pixel appears to be in real-world space, where AngleX and AngleY are relative to the straight-ahead vector.
        // If your renderer is a raytracer, you can use this vector directly (normalize as appropriate).
        // However in standard rasterisers, we have rendered a 2D image and are putting it in front of the eye,
        //      so we then need a mapping from this space to the [-1,1] UV coordinate space, which depends on exactly
        //      where "in space" the app wants to put that rendertarget.
